            <h2>Bar Graphs</h2>

            <hr>

            <p><img src="/templates/resources/barchart.png" alt="bar graph" align="right">A bar graph is a graphical display of data using bars of different heights, which can be plotted either
                horizontally or vertically. Bar graphs are used to compare things between different groups or to track
                changes over time. However, when trying to measure change over time, bar graphs are best when the
                changes are larger.</p>

            <p>Bar graphs are used to provide a visual representation of categorical data, which is data that is grouped
                by alike characteristics, such as days of the week, months of the year, etc.</p>

            <p>In addition to standard bar graphs, there are also two other types of bar graphs: grouped bar graphs and stacked bar graphs.</p>

            <p><img src="/templates/resources/grouped-bar-chart.png" alt="grouped bar chart" align="left">Grouped bar graphs are bar graphs that compared multiple sets of data items. It is generally best to associate
                each sub item in the group with a color to keep consistency and make the chart more easily readable.</p>

            <p><img src="/templates/resources/stacked-bar-chart.png" alt="stacked bar chart" align="right">Stacked bar graphs are used to breakdown parts of a whole. Each bar in the chart represents a whole, and
                segments in the bar represent different parts or categories of that whole. Different colors are used to
                illustrate the different categories in the bar.</p>

                            connected by straight line segments. Unlike scatter plots, measurement points are ordered and connected
                            together.</p>

            <p>Line graphs are visualizations used to track changes over short and long periods of time. When smaller
                changes exist, line graphs are better to use than bar graphs. Line graphs can also be used to compare
                changes over the same period of time for more than one group.</p>



            <p>Line graphs can track either one dataset or multiple sets related to an independent variable and are useful

                        <p>A pie chart is a circular graph that chunks the data into "pie slices", which are proportionally accurate
                            percentage-wise to the quantity it represents. It is a way of summarizing a set of nominal data or displaying
                            the different values of a given variable (e.g. percentage distribution).</p>

                        <p>Pie charts are best used for displaying categorical data and to display how something is composed. On the other hand,
                            they don't work very well for comparing groups to each other.</p>

                        <p>When constructing a pie chart, best practice is order data items from largest to smallest, with the smallest

            <h2>Histograms</h2>

            <hr>

            <img src="/templates/resources/histogram.png" alt="histogram of temperature ranges in New York City" align="left">

            <p>A histogram is a chart that plots the distribution of a numeric variable’s values as a series of bars.
                Each bar typically covers a range of numeric values called a bin or class; a bar’s height indicates the
                frequency of data points with a value within the corresponding bin.</p>

            <img src="/templates/resources/histogram-vs-bar-graph.png" alt="comparison between histograms and bar charts" align="right" min-width="50%" height="50%">
            <p>While they may look similar to bar charts, Histograms are used to show distributions of variables while
                bar charts are used to compare variables. Histograms plot quantitative data with ranges of the data
                grouped into bins or intervals while bar charts plot categorical data.</p>

            <p>Histograms are used to summarize discrete or continuous data that are measured on an interval scale.</p>

            <p>Histograms are good for showing general distributional features of dataset variables. You can see roughly
                where the peaks of the distribution are, whether the distribution is skewed or symmetric, and if there
                are any outliers.</p>

            <p>An important aspect of histograms is that they must be plotted with a zero-valued baseline. Since the
                frequency of data in each bin is implied by the height of each bar, changing the baseline or introducing
                a gap in the scale will skew the perception of the distribution of data.</p>

            <h2>Scatter Plots</h2>

            <hr>

            <img src="/templates/resources/scatterplot.png" alt="scatterplot" align="right">

            <p>A scatter plot (aka scatter chart, scatter graph) uses dots to represent values for two different numeric
                variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual
                data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.</p>

            <p>A scatter plot's primary use is to observe and show relationships between two numeric variables. The dots in a scatter
                plot not only report the values of individual data points, but also patterns when the data are taken as a whole.</p>

            <img src="/templates/resources/scatterplot.gif" alt="scatterplot with a line of best fit">
            <p>A common best practice with scatter plots is to make use of a trend line when looking at predictive or
                correlational relationship between variables. It is common to add a trend line to the plot showing the
                mathematically best fit to the data; this can provide an additional signal as to how strong the relationship
                between the two variables is, and if there are any unusual points that are affecting the computation of the trend line.</p>

            <img src="/templates/resources/box-plot.png" alt="box plot" align="left">

            <p>A box plot or boxplot (also known as box and whisker plot) is a type of chart
                often used in explanatory data analysis. Box plots visually show the distribution of numerical data and
                skewness through displaying the data quartiles (or percentiles) and averages.</p>

            <p>A box plot is ideal for comparing distributions because the centre, spread and overall range are immediately
                apparent. They also have the advantage of taking up less space, which is useful when comparing distributions
                between many groups or datasets.</p>

            <p>Box plots are used to help visualize the distribution of quantitative values in a field. They are also
                valuable for comparisons across different categorical variables or identifying outliers, if either of
                those exist in a dataset. Its ideal use is for comparing distributions because the centre, spread and
                overall range are immediately apparent.</p>
