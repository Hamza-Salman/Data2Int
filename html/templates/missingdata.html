            <p> As a data analyst, it is a common phenomenon to encounter data sets that lack a value for an attribute
                sporadically.
                This concept is called <b>missing data</b>. This page will explain, the different types and how to deal
                with it from
                a data science perspective.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Missing Data</h3>
            <p>There are three types of missing data:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Missing not at random <b>(MNAR)</b> - if the missing data follows a predictable pattern throughout
                    either the entirety or a portion of the dataset,
                    it is usually classified as MNAR; it is generally for related to data not being measured by the
                    study. It follows a familiar pattern to a data analyst
                    because the reason for the missing variable is tied directly to why the data is missing to begin
                    with. ex: A survey about mental illness is administered.
                    A person with depression is less likely to complete the survey about depression, than someone
                    without.
                </li>
                <li>Missing at random <b>(MAR)</b> - it is similar to MAR, except that the missing data is related <i>to
                    data being measured by the study</i>. Usually when data is
                    MAR, there is noticeable pattern within subgroups of the dataset. ex: a study tracks the race of
                    each participant in a study about grocery stores prices, but a particular
                    ethnic group is less likely to finish the survey. This example is MAR because there is no
                    discernible correlation between race and the prices of groceries.
                </li>
                <li>Missing completely at random <b>(MCAR)</b> - if the missing data is missing notwithstanding of the
                    expected value or similar examples of complete data,
                    the data is considered MCAR. This can occur for external reasons unrelated to the factors being
                    measured or related.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to handle missing data</h3>

            <p>There are several different techniques to handling the the dilemma of missing data:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Imputation - if the missing data cannot be removed without affecting the results' reliability, it's
                    better to use statistical methods to try and
                    estimate the missing values, such as time-series methods, interpolation, and calculating the mean,
                    median, and mode.
                </li>
                <li>Deletion - There are three types of deletion:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Listwise: if one attribute in a record is missing, the entire record is excluded; the
                            drawback to this is that your sample population size
                            for analysis shrink everytime a record is omitted.
                        </li>
                        <li>Pairwise: the record is used with the non-missing values, but the attribute with the missing
                            value is omitted. The disadvantage to this technique is
                            that this produce a larger margin of error because of missing values in the set.
                        </li>
                        <li>Drop the attribute: if a large enough portion (more than half) of an attribute has missing
                            data and the attribute is trivial to the data analysis, it
                            may be worth it to omit it completely.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
