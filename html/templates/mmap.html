                            <p> In some news reports and business magazines, it is often seen that maps are used to analyze and display commercial phenomena. Such a form that uses maps to reflect and analyze data is called a data map. Data maps are very intuitive and visual expressions in the process of business data analysis. You can use maps to show sales and profits in various regions, or to display the distribution of warehouses all over the country to optimize transportation networks. As another example, if we need to count the flow of people and distribution of shopping malls, heatmaps can help us achieve targeted advertising.</p><br>
